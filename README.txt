Update of some code to run spine-hx on latest haxeflixel. Avoiding the latest spine-haxe which uses Ceramic as renderer.
I created this project for others like me who,
1. Don't want to use Ceramic framework.
2. Prefer Haxeflixel over heaps for building small indie games.
   a. Android works out of the box
   b. Built in collision detection.
   c. Lot's of haxeflixel samples and easy examples.

3. Supports v4.0.xx spine files.
   a. Additive blending works.
   b. Clipping is not supported.
